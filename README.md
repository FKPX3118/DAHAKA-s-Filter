# DAHAKA-s-Filter

DAHAKA’s Filter is a custom filter for path of exile, based on [Neversink’s Filter](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter). It helps to show rare or higher items, with different colors, sounds, icons, and beams. It hides useless or cluttering items. It is easy to customize and update on [Filterblade](https://www.filterblade.xyz/).
