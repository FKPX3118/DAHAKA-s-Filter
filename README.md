  <summary><i>Click to see more</i></summary>
  
  ### Step 1
  Visit the [FilterBlade](https://www.filterblade.xyz/) and log in with your account. If you don‚Äôt have an account, you can create one for free by linking your Path of Exile account.
  
  <img src="https://github.com/FKPX3118/DAHAKA-s-Filter/assets/16643996/2472cdd3-a559-43fa-8c1d-20d818309a86" alt="Image" width="400">
  
  ### Step 2
  On the FilterBlade homepage, you can choose to load your own filter or use Neversink‚Äôs stable version, which is the default option. You can also select the strictness level of the filter, which determines how much loot is shown or hidden. The higher the strictness, the less loot you will see, but the more valuable it will be.

  ### Step 3
  To apply DAHAKA‚Äôs presets, go to the Overview tab and click on Presets.

  Then, click on Public and enter ‚ÄúFKPX3118‚Äù in the By Author field. Click on Search to find DAHAKA‚Äôs presets.
  
  You will see a list of presets that you can add to your filter.

  These include: 0-Tiering, 1-Style, 2-SoundPack, 3-Strictness, and 4-Leveling add-on.

  ### Step 4
  
  All of these presets are optional. You can add any or all of them to your filter by clicking "Add." Once you have selected the presets you want, click "Apply" to confirm your changes.

  *Note1: If you want to use the strictness preset, make sure to select the same strictness level as the one you chose in Step 2. Otherwise, your filter may not work as intended.*
  
  *Note2: If you want to add multiple presets, you need to add them in order from 0 to 4. This will ensure that the presets are applied correctly and do not conflict with each other.*

  *Note3: If you want to use the SoundPack, you'll need the [sound file](https://github.com/FKPX3118/DAHAKA-s-Filter/blob/main/README.md#sound-file) to be installed.*
