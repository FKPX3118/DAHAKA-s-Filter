# DAHAKA's Filter

DAHAKA’s Filter is a custom filter for Path of Exile, based on [Neversink’s Filter](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter). It helps to show rare or higher items, with different colors, sounds, icons, and beams. It hides useless or cluttering items. It is easy to customize and update on [Filterblade](https://www.filterblade.xyz/).

  ### Step 2
  On the FilterBlade homepage, you can choose to load your own filter or use Neversink’s stable version, which is the default option. You can also select the strictness level of the filter, which determines how much loot is shown or hidden. The higher the strictness, the less loot you will see, but the more valuable it will be.

  ### Step 3

  ### Step 4
  You will see a list of presets that you can add to your filter. They are: 0-Tiering, 1-Style, 2-SoundPack, 3-Strictness, 4-Leveling add-on

  All are optional. You can add any or all of these presets to your filter by clicking add. After you have added the presets you want, click on Apply to confirm your changes.

  *Note: If you want to use the strictness preset, make sure to select the same strictness level as the one you chose in Step 2. Otherwise, your filter may not work as intended.*
  
  *Note: If you want to add multiple presets, you need to add them in order from 0 to 4. This will ensure that the presets are applied correctly and do not conflict with each other.*

  *Note: If you want to use the SoundPack, you'll need the [sound file](https://github.com/FKPX3118/DAHAKA-s-Filter/blob/main/README.md#sound-file) to be installed.*
