# 🌟 DAHAKA's Filter

**DAHAKA’s Filter** is a customizable, preset-based filter for Path of Exile, inspired by [Neversink’s Filter](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter). It helps to show rare or higher items, with different colors, sounds, icons, and beams. It hides useless or cluttering items. It is easy to customize and update on [Filterblade](https://www.filterblade.xyz/).

## 🎨 Overview
>- [Style Overview](https://github.com/FKPX3118/DAHAKA-s-Filter/blob/main/Filter%20Overview%203.22.png)

&nbsp;
  
## ⚙️ Features
- ### 🛡️ Based on [Neversink’s Filter](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter)
  
  * Easiest way to manage your filters, customize them to your liking, and get fast updates
  
- ### 🧬Preset-Based Architecture

  * Unlike typical filters, DAHAKA’s Filter is entirely preset-based. This means it is divided into several independent aspects, ensuring that changes in one aspect do not affect the others.

  * Each aspect can be individually added to your custom filter, or you can assemble all of them to create the complete DAHAKA’s Filter. This flexibility allows you to tailor the filter to your specific needs and preferences, ensuring an optimized and clutter-free gaming experience.

- ### 🎛️ Presets Order
  * **0-Tiering**
    
    >Customized item filter by assigning tiers to items based on league economy
    
  * **1-Style**
    
    >A variant of the standard Neversink Filter style, offering a familiar yet distinct visual and auditory experience
    
  * **2-SoundPack**
  
    >Enhance your immersion with a sound pack that blends Diablo II and default sounds, providing a more engaging item drop audio experience

    >Choose from 7 levels of strictness, each with its own tweaks to optimize loot filtering for different needs and strategies
  
  * **4-Leveling Add-on**

- ### 🚀 Leveling add-on for league starter builds

  ### Step 2
  >On the FilterBlade homepage, you can choose to load your own filter or use Neversink’s stable version, which is the default option. You can also select the strictness level of the filter, which determines how much loot is shown or hidden. The higher the strictness, the less loot you will see, but the more valuable it will be.
