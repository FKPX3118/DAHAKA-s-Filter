# 🌟 DAHAKA's Filter

**DAHAKA's Filter** is a customizable, preset-based filter for Path of Exile, inspired by [Neversink's Filter](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter). It helps to show rare or higher items, with different colors, sounds, icons, and beams. It hides useless or cluttering items. It is easy to customize and update on [Filterblade](https://www.filterblade.xyz/).

## ⚙️ Features
- ### 🛡️ Based on [Neversink's Filter](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-Filter)
  
  * Easiest way to manage your filters, customize them to your liking, and get fast updates
  
- ### 🧬Module-Based Architecture

  * Unlike typical filters, DAHAKA's Filter is entirely preset-based. This means it is divided into several independent aspects, ensuring that changes in one aspect do not affect the others.

  * Each aspect can be individually added to your custom filter, or you can assemble all of them to create the complete DAHAKA's Filter. This flexibility allows you to tailor the filter to your specific needs and preferences, ensuring an optimized and clutter-free gaming experience.

- ### 🎛️ Module Introduction
  * **0 - Tiering**
    
    >Customized item tiering based on the league economy
    >
    >You can check [How the tiering of DAHAKA's Filter is determined](https://github.com/FKPX3118/DAHAKA-s-Filter/wiki/How-the-tiering-of-DAHAKA's-Filter-is-determined) to see the full details on how tiering was determined, along with the mathematical background behind it
    
  * **1 - Style**
    
    >A variant of the standard Neversink Filter style, offering a familiar yet distinct visual and auditory experience
    
  * **2 - SoundPack**
  
    >Enhance your immersion with a sound pack that blends Diablo II and default sounds, providing a more engaging item drop audio experience
    
  * **3-Strictness**
    
    >Choose from 7 levels of strictness, each with its own tweaks to optimize loot filtering for different needs and strategies
  
  * **4 - Leveling Add-on**
  
    >Enable additional features designed to make leveling faster and smoother. This add-on follows various specific, authoritative league starter build guides to ensure an efficient progression
  fully compatibility to other filters and presets

  * **5 - Magic-find Add-on**
    
    >A unique and fractured bases blocker. This feature allows you to generate two different filters, enabling you to switch seamlessly between picking up currency and checking items on the ground.
    
- ### 🚀 Leveling add-on for league starter builds

  * The **Leveling Add-on** highlights specific weapons, socket color combinations, specific flasks, and essential recipes for different league starter builds. Additionally, if a build has a transition using different skill gems and weapons, the Leveling Add-on ensures this happens at the appropriate level.

  * There are now various Leveling Add-ons for several reliable league starter builds:

  ### Step 1
  >Visit the [FilterBlade](https://www.filterblade.xyz/) and log in with your account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free by linking your Path of Exile account.

  ><img src="https://github.com/FKPX3118/DAHAKA-s-Filter/assets/16643996/2472cdd3-a559-43fa-8c1d-20d818309a86" alt="Image" width="400">
  
  ### Step 2
  >On the FilterBlade homepage, you can choose to load your own favorite filter or use Neversink's stable version(recommend), which is the default option. You can also select the strictness level of the filter, which determines how much loot is shown or hidden. The higher the strictness, the less loot you will see, but the more valuable it will be. Remember to choose the same strictness level of DAHAKA's Filter if you want to use this 3-Strictness module.

## 🔄 How to update
You need to click “Load” on your filter every time FilterBlade, Neversink, or I push an update. Unless you become a [patreon support](https://www.patreon.com/Neversink) on Filterblade, you can open your filter setting and switch "Auto-Update" on.
